		If you're having girl problems I feel bad for you son<br>
I got ninety-nine problems but a bitch ain't one<br>
I got the rap patrol on the gat patrol<br>
Foes that want to make sure my casket's closed<br>
Rap critics that say he's "Money Cash Hoes"<br>
I'm from the hood, stupid, what type of facts are those?<br>
If you grew up with holes in your zapatos<br>
You'd celebrate the minute you was having dough<br>
I'm like, "F*ck critics" you can kiss my whole asshole<br>
If you don't like my lyrics, you can press fast forward<br>
Got beef with radio if I don't play they show<br>
They don't play my hits, well, I don't give a shit, so<br>
Rap mags try and use my black ass<br>
So advertisers can give 'em more cash for ads, fuckers<br>
I don't know what you take me as<br>
Or understand the intelligence that Jay-Z has<br>
I'm from rags to riches, niggas I ain't dumb<br>
I got ninety nine problems but a bitch ain't one, hit me<br>
Ninety nine problems but a bitch ain't one<br>
If you having girl problems I feel bad for you son<br>
I got ninety nine problems but a bitch ain't one, hit me<br>
The year's '94 and my trunk is raw<br>
In my rearview mirror is the motherfucking law<br>
I got two choices y'all, pull over the car or<br>
Bounce on the devil, put the pedal to the floor<br>
Now I ain't trying to see no highway chase with Jake<br>
Plus I got a few dollars I can fight the case<br>
So I, pull over to the side of the road<br>
I heard, "Son, do you know why I'm stopping you for?"<br>
"Cause I'm young and I'm black and my hat's real low"<br>
Do I look like a mind reader, sir? I don't know<br>
Am I under arrest or should I guess some more?<br>
"Well you was doing fifty-five in a fifty-four" (uh huh)<br>
"License and registration and step out of the car"<br>
"Are you carrying a weapon on you, I know a lot of you are"<br>
I ain't stepping out of shit, all my papers legit<br>
"Well do you mind if I look around the car a little bit?"<br>
Well my glove compartment is locked, so is the trunk in the back<br>
And I know my rights so you goin' need a warrant for that<br>
"Aren't you sharp as a tack? You some type of lawyer or something?"<br>
"Somebody important or something?"<br>
Well, I ain't passed the bar, but I know a little bit<br>
Enough that you won't illegally search my shit<br>
"Well we'll see how smart you are when the K-9 come"<br>
I got ninety nine problems but a bitch ain't one, hit me<br>
Ninety nine problems but a bitch ain't one<br>
If you having girl problems I feel bad for you son<br>
I got ninety nine problems but a bitch ain't one, hit me<br>
Ninety nine problems but a bitch ain't one<br>
If you having girl problems I feel bad for you son<br>
I got ninety nine problems but a bitch ain't one, hit me<br>
Now once upon a time not too long ago<br>
A nigga like myself had to strong-arm a ho<br>
This is not a ho in the sense of having a pussy<br>
But a pussy having no goddamn sense try and push me<br>
I tried to ignore 'em, talk to the Lord<br>
Pray for 'em, 'cause some fools just love to perform<br>
You know the type, loud as a motorbike<br>
But wouldn't bust a grape in a fruit fight<br>
The only thing that's goin' happen is I'ma get to clapping and<br>
He and his boys goin' be yapping to the Captain<br>
And there I go trapped in the Kit-Kat again<br>
Back through the system with the riff-raff again<br>
Fiends on the floor scratching again<br>
Paparazzi's with they cameras, snapping 'em<br>
D.A. tried to give a nigga shaft again<br>
Half a mil' for bail 'cause I'm African<br>
All because this fool was harassing them<br>
Trying to play the boy like he's saccharine<br>
But ain't nothing sweet 'bout how I hold my gun<br>
I got ninety-nine problems being a bitch ain't one, hit me<br>
Ninety-nine problems but a bitch ain't one<br>
If you having girl problems I feel bad for you son<br>
I got ninety-nine problems but a bitch ain't one, hit me<br>
Ninety-nine problems but a bitch ain't one<br>
If you having girl problems I feel bad for you son<br>
I got ninety-nine problems but a bitch ain't one, hit me<br>
Having girl problems I feel bad for you son<br>
I got ninety-nine problems and a bitch ain't one<br>
You're crazy for this one, Rick, it's your boy<br>
