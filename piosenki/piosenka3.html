		Yea, yea I'm out that Brooklyn, now I'm down in Tribeca<br>
Right next to DeNiro, but I'll be hood forever<br>
I'm the new Sinatra, and, since I made it here<br>
I can make it anywhere, yea, they love me everywhere I used to cop in Harlem,                   <br>
All of my Dominicano's right there up on Broadway,<br>
Pull me back to that McDonald's, took it to my stashbox, 560 State St.<br>
Catch me in the kitchen like a Simmons wippin' pastry's<br>
Cruisin' down 8th St., off white Lexus<br>
Drivin' so slow, but BK is from Texas<br>
Me, I'm out that Bed-Stuy, home of that boy Biggie<br>
Now I live on Billboard and I brought my boys with me<br>
Say whattup to Ty-Ty, still sippin' Mai Tai's<br>
Sittin' courtside, Knicks and Nets give me high five<br>
Nigga I be Spike'd out, I could trip a referee<br>
Tell by my attitude that I'm most definitely from<br>
In New York,<br>
Concrete jungle where dreams are made of<br>
There's nothin' you can't do<br>
Now you're in New York<br>
These streets will make you feel brand new<br>
Big lights will inspire you<br>
Let's hear it for New York, New York, New York<br>
Catch me at the X with OG at a Yankee game<br>
Shit, I made the Yankee hat more famous then a Yankee can<br>
You should know I bleed blue, but I ain't a Crip though<br>
But I got a gang of niggas walkin' with my clique though<br>
Welcome to the melting pot, corners where we sellin' rock<br>
Afrika Bambataa shit, home of the hip-hop<br>
Yellow cab, gypsy cab, dollar cab, holla back<br>
For foreigners it ain't for, they act like they forgot how to act<br>
Eight million stories, out there in it naked<br>
City is a pity, half of y'all won't make it<br>
Me, I got a plug, Special Ed "I Got It Made"<br>
If Jesus payin' Lebron, I'm payin' Dwyane Wade<br>
Three dice cee-lo, three card monte<br>
Labor Day Parade, rest in peace Bob Marley<br>
Statue of Liberty, long live the World Trade<br>
Long live the King yo, I'm from the Empire St. that's<br>
In New York,<br>
Concrete jungle where dreams are made of<br>
There's nothin' you can't do<br>
Now you're in New York<br>
These streets will make you feel brand new<br>
Big lights will inspire you<br>
Let's hear it for New York, New York, New York<br>
Lights is blinding, girls need blinders<br>
So they can step out of bounds quick, the sidelines is<br>
Lined with casualties, who sip to life casually<br>
Then gradually become worse, don't bite the apple, Eve<br>
Caught up in the in-crowd, now you're in style<br>
End of the winter gets cold, en vogue, with your skin out<br>
City of sin, it's a pity on the whim<br>
Good girls gone bad, the city's filled with them<br>
Mommy took a bus trip, now she got her bust out<br>
Everybody ride her, just like a bus route<br>
Hail Mary to the city, you're a virgin<br>
And Jesus can't save you, life starts when the church end<br>
Came here for school, graduated to the high life<br>
Ball players, rap stars, addicted to the limelight<br>
MDMA got you feelin' like a champion<br>
The city never sleeps, better slip you an Ambien<br>
In New York,<br>
Concrete jungle where dreams are made of<br>
There's nothin' you can't do<br>
Now you're in New York<br>
These streets will make you feel brand new<br>
Big lights will inspire you<br>
Let's hear it for New York, New York, New York<br>
One hand in the air for the big city<br>
Street lights, big dreams, all lookin' pretty<br>
No place in the world that could compare<br>
Put your lighters in the air everybody say yeah, yeah,<br>
Yea, yea<br>
In New York,<br>
Concrete jungle where dreams are made of<br>
There's nothin' you can't do<br>
Now you're in New York<br>
These streets will make you feel brand new<br>
Big lights will inspire you<br>
Let's hear it for New York, New York, New York<br>
