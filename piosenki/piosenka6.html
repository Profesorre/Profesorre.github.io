		In the heart of holy see<br>
In the home of Christianity<br>
The seat of power is in danger<br>
There's a foe of a thousand swords<br>
They've been abandoned by their lords<br>
Their fall from grace will pave their path, to damnation<br>
Then the 189<br>
In the service of heaven<br>
They're protecting the holy line<br>
It was 1527<br>
Gave their lives on the steps to heaven<br>
Thy will be done!<br>
For the grace, for the might of our lord<br>
For the home of the holy<br>
For the faith, for the way of the sword<br>
Gave their lives so boldly<br>
For the grace, for the might of our lord<br>
In the name of his glory<br>
For the faith, for the way of the sword<br>
Come and tell their story again<br>
Under guard of 42<br>
Along a secret avenue<br>
Castle saint Angelo is waiting<br>
They're the guard of the holy see<br>
They're the guards of Christianity<br>
Their path to history is paved with salvation<br>
Then the 189<br>
In the service of heaven<br>
They're protecting the holy line<br>
It was 1527<br>
Gave their lives on the steps to heaven<br>
Thy will be done!<br>
For the grace, for the might of our lord<br>
For the home of the holy<br>
For the faith, for the way of the sword<br>
Gave their lives so boldly<br>
For the grace, for the might of our lord<br>
In the name of his glory<br>
For the faith, for the way of the sword<br>
Come and tell their story again<br>
Dying for salvation with dedication<br>
No capitulation, annihilation<br>
Papal commendation, reincarnation<br>
Heaven is your destination<br>
Dying for salvation with dedication<br>
No capitulation, annihilation<br>
Papal commendation, reincarnation<br>
Heaven is your destination<br>
In the name of god<br>
For the grace, for the might of our lord<br>
For the home of the holy<br>
For the faith, for the way of the sword<br>
Gave their lives so boldly<br>
For the grace, for the might of our lord<br>
In the name of his glory<br>
For the faith, for the way of the sword<br>
Come and tell their story<br>
Gave their lives so boldly<br>
Come and tell the Swiss Guards' story again<br>
